/**
 * The web app's half of the web app ↔ browser extension bridge.
 *
 * The store extension has no host permissions and no `cookies` permission, so
 * it can no longer read this app's session cookie. Instead the PAGE tells the
 * extension who is signed in (`sync`), and the extension answers with what the
 * page should do about it. The protocol, its decoders and the reasons for its
 * shape are `@starter/shared/extension-bridge`; this module is only the page's
 * decisions, with every effect injected so the tests drive it without Chrome,
 * a server or React.
 *
 * What the page does with a reply, and nothing else:
 *
 *  - `approve-device`: the extension started an RFC 8628 device authorization
 *    for itself and wants this page's session to approve it. The page checks
 *    the signed-in user is still the one it described, approves with its own
 *    cookie (claim + approve, `lib/device-approve.ts`) and tells the extension
 *    how that went. The extension then fetches its OWN token from the server;
 *    no credential crosses the bridge. The code is never shown and never taken
 *    from anywhere but a reply of a pinned extension id.
 *  - `sign-out-web`: the extension was signed out on purpose after this
 *    session began. The page signs out through the app's normal `signOut()`,
 *    and the protected layout moves the person to /login as it would for any
 *    other sign-out.
 *  - `none`: nothing.
 *
 * Everything unrecognised is ignored — an extension that is missing, older,
 * newer or somebody else's is indistinguishable from "no extension".
