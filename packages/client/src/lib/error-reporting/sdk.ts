/**
 * The part of `@sentry/browser` the reporter uses, re-exported by name.
 *
 * `reporter.ts` loads this file with a dynamic import, never the package: a
 * dynamic `import("@sentry/browser")` takes the whole namespace — replay,
 * feedback, tracing and every integration the reporter never starts, about
 * 430 KB minified — because a namespace cannot be tree-shaken. A module that
 * re-exports the names it needs can be, so the lazily loaded chunk holds
 * only these. Nothing else imports this file, and nothing imports it
 * without the DSN condition in front.
