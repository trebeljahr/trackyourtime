/**
 * A version stamp for structured values a client persists on the device.
 *
 * Every client keeps JSON in some local store — Capacitor Preferences,
 * `chrome.storage.local`, Raycast's `LocalStorage` — and every one of those
 * values outlives the build that wrote it. The next build reads it, and so does
 * the previous one when a person rolls back, installs an older store build, or
 * runs a stale unpacked extension beside a new one. Without a version, a reader
 * can only guess whether a value is a shape it understands, and a wrong guess
 * becomes `NaN` money, an `undefined.trim()` or a timer seeded from garbage.
 *
 * So a structured value is written as `{ v, data }`, and read back through a
 * spec that says which versions this build understands:
 *
 *  - `v` equal to the current version → `decode(data)`.
 *  - no envelope at all → `legacy(value)`, for values written before the
 *    envelope existed. Keys are contracts and are never renamed, so the same
 *    key holds both shapes for as long as an old install can still be updated.
 *  - an older `v` → `older[v](data)` when the spec has one, a miss otherwise.
 *  - a HIGHER `v` → a miss. A newer build wrote it and this one cannot know
 *    what the fields mean now.
 *
 * A miss is `null`, and for a cache that is the right answer: the caller
 * refetches. Nothing here ever throws — a store that cannot be read must never
 * take down the surface that was only trying to paint faster.
 *
 * NOT for user data that has no other copy (the offline queue): a value that
 * cannot be decoded there must be held, never read as a miss and overwritten.
