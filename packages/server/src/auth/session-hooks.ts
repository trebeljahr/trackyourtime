 * to ask "which client is this?" would drag in an adapter and a database for a
 * question that is answered from three fields on a request.
 *
 * `session-lifetime.integration.test.ts` runs the other half — the same hooks
 * wired into a real better-auth instance — because "the hook returned the
 * right date" and "better-auth wrote it" are different claims, and only the

 * Reading the row also closes the reverse hole: a browser session cannot talk
 * itself into the long window later by sending `x-trackyourtime-client: mobile` on
 * a refresh — the window is fixed at sign-in, when the label is also what the
 * devices list will show.
