/**
 * File-watcher trouble in `pnpm run dev`: stray watchers left by earlier runs,
 * and the moment a watcher cannot be opened at all.
 *
 * The failure this exists for is silent. When Watchpack cannot open watches
 * (`EMFILE: too many open files, watch`), `next dev` never scans `app/`, so no
 * route is registered and every page answers a plain 404 while `public/` files
 * still load — no error page, nothing that points at the cause. What exhausted
 * the watches was `tsx watch` processes from earlier dev runs, still alive days
 * after the terminal or agent that started them was gone.
 *
 * Pure functions over `ps` output, so `dev-watchers.test.mjs` covers them
 * without starting anything. Nothing here kills a process: whose process it is
 * is for a person to decide.
