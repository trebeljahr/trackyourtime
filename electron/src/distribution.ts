/*
 * Which channel installed this copy of the app, and what that channel owns.
 *
 * One binary is built per target, but the runtime still has to know where it
 * came from, because two things differ per channel and fail quietly if a
 * store build behaves like a direct download:
 *
 *   - **Updates.** A store (Mac App Store, Microsoft Store, Snap Store,
 *     Flathub) replaces the app itself; an in-app updater there either cannot
 *     write to its own bundle (MAS sandbox, MSIX, a read-only squashfs, a
 *     Flatpak's /app) or fights the store. The updater (`updater-model.ts`,
 *     `updaterPolicy`) stays off everywhere `selfUpdates` answers false. A
 *     Homebrew cask installs the same Developer ID build as the website, so it
 *     cannot be told apart here and does update itself; the cask says
 *     `auto_updates true`. deb, rpm and tar.gz are all `linux-package`, left
 *     to the package manager or the person. electron-builder's
 *     `resources/package-type` would tell them apart, but none of the three
 *     updates itself, so nothing reads it.
 *
 *   - **Open at login.** See `loginItemMechanism`.
 *
 * Pure: every input is passed in, so each channel is a unit test rather than a
 * build for another OS.

 * How "Open at login" works for a channel.
 *
 * - macOS, direct and App Store alike: `app.setLoginItemSettings`, which is
 *   SMAppService on macOS 13+ and is allowed inside the App Sandbox.
 * - Windows direct: the same Electron call (the `Run` registry key).
 * - **Microsoft Store: unsupported.** A packaged app's `Run` key is
 *   virtualised and never read at login; the supported route is a
 *   `windows.startupTask` extension in the manifest plus the WinRT
 *   `StartupTask` API, which Electron does not expose.
 * - AppImage: an XDG autostart entry pointing at `$APPIMAGE` (the executable
 *   path is inside a mount that disappears on exit).
 * - Snap: the same entry, written under the snap's own `$HOME`
 *   (`$SNAP_USER_DATA`), which is exactly where snapd's `autostart:` key looks;
 *   electron-builder's `snap.autoStart` declares it. snapd rewrites the Exec
 *   line to the snap's command, so it names `/snap/bin/<name>`.
 * - **Flatpak: unsupported.** Writing the host's `~/.config/autostart` needs a
 *   filesystem hole Flathub review refuses, and the Background portal's
 *   autostart request is not reachable from Electron.
 * - deb/rpm: an XDG entry pointing at the installed executable.
